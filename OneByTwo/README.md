# OneByTwo - Restaurant Revenue Sharing

### Overview

A Web3 consumer project leveraging the `stype` from Seismic. The app allows restaurants to mint tokens
that entitle frequent customers to a portion of their revenue.

Every time someone dines at the restaurant, a portion of the purchase is placed into a revenue pool. Token holders
can cash out of the revenue pool at a proportion equal to their proportion of the total available tokens. Restaurants can
allocate tokens as they see fit.
