# OneByTwo - Restaurant Revenue Sharing

### Overview

OneByTwo allows restaurants to mint tokens that entitle frequent customers to a portion of their revenue.

**Problem:**
Small businesses rely on strong local communities, but in cities with countless dining options, it's hard to stand out, attract an initial customer base, and maintain long-term engagement. Combined with the thin margins emblematic of restaurants and price pressures from corporate competitors, enfranchsing our local businesses requires more than just consumer choice.

**Insight:**
By letting customers become partial owners, small businesses can foster a deeper sense of loyalty. When customers are invested, they're more likely to promote the business, spend more, and provide valuable feedback. This also provides restaurants with access to a capital pool that the traditional finance system does not make available to them.

**Solution:**
Offer a platform where customer loyalty translates into a share of the restaurant's revenue. Using Seismic's privacy features, all sensitive data—like individual identities and spending habits—remains confidential, ensuring trust and security for both businesses and customers.
