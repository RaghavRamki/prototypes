# RIFF

## Problem
Trading experience on every Automated Market Maker (AMM) is the same, it's time for something radically different like Riff.

## Insight
What if we used other senses like hearing to make calls?

## Solution
Make a price chart that you can listen to - users pay to listen to reveal interesting market trends.
