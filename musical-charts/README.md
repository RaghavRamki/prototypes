# RIFF

## Overview
**Riff** work on creating an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where people can swap tokens only after listening to music. Users experience market trends through AI generated violin music, and they are allowed to make a trade signal after they have listened to the generated music. The project is more fun because each trade triggers a new violin melody based on the market data, ensuring a fresh and engaging experience every time for the user.

## Problem
Trading experience on every AMM is the same, it's time for something radically different like Riff.

## Insight
We can use other senses like music sound to make trading calls.

## Solution
Force people to listen to price charts, where the encrypted price is only accessible by an AI agent that plays music to anyone that wants to get price information
